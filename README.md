=============

-GameModel.m
  This is an objective-c source file that contains the model code for a simple blackjack game. 
  It is referenced by a seperate viewController class and has notifications for certain events. 
  Not terribly complex, but it shows that I know the basics of objective-c.
  
-Patch.cpp
  This is a c++ source file that contains the model code for a 'Patch' object which in this case is a 2-dimensional bezier curve.
  This just shows of a bit of fun math and logic for making curved surfaces in graphics programming.
  
-BlurShader.glsl
  This is a shader written for openGL as a post-processing effect to perform a 2-pass gaussian blur on a render buffer. 
  
-Vector.cpp
  Not complicated, just a general c++ source file for holding 3-d vectors with operator overloads.
